Keywords:
---------
 Keywords in C can be defined as the pre-defined or the reserved words having its own importance, and each keyword has its own functionality. Since keywords are the pre-defined words used by the compiler, so they cannot be used as the variable names. If the keywords are used as the variable names, it means that we are assigning a different meaning to the keyword, which is not allowed. C language supports 32 keywords given below:

auto 	double 	int 	struct
break 	else 	long 	switch
case 	enum 	register 	typedef
char 	extern 	return 	union
const 	float 	short 	unsigned
continue 	for 	signed 	void
default 	goto 	sizeof 	volatile
do 	if 	static 	while
