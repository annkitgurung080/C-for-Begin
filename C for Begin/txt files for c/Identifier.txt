Identifiers:

Identifiers in C are used for naming variables, functions, arrays, structures, etc. Identifiers in C are the user-defined words. It can be composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, underscore, or digits, but the starting letter should be either an underscore or an alphabet. Identifiers cannot be used as keywords. Rules for constructing identifiers in C are given below:

1. The first character of an identifier should be either an alphabet or an underscore, and then it can be followed by any of the character, digit, or underscore.

2. It should not begin with any numerical digit.

3. In identifiers, both uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore, we can say that identifiers are case sensitive.

4. Commas or blank spaces cannot be specified within an identifier.

5. Keywords cannot be represented as an identifier.
 
6. The length of the identifiers should not be more than 31 characters.
Identifiers should be written in such a way that it is meaningful, short, and easy to read.
